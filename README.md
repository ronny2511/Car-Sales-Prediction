This is a machine learning project that predicts the price of used cars based on their features such as mileage, age, make and model, and other relevant factors.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information about used cars from various car brands. The dataset has over 10,000 observations with 8 features, including the target variable (price).

## Methodology
We have used a regression model to predict the price of used cars. We have performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and preprocess the data for model training. We have used several machine learning algorithms to build the regression model, including linear regression, decision tree regression, and random forest regression. We have also performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the model.

## Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
os

## Results
We have evaluated the performance of the model using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics. The final model has an accuracy_score of 0.88. This indicates that the model has a good fit and can predict the price of used cars accurately.

## Usage
To use the model, you can input the features of the car (horsepower, enginesize etc.) into the trained model, and it will predict the price of the car based on the input.
